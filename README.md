Developed a Machine Learning model that utilizes data such as Age,Cholestrol, Smoking habits e.t.c, to predict Heart disease risk in an individual. We utilized various Machine Learning Libraries to achieve this task. Firstly we performed EDA on data. Later we applied Naive Bayes model on the data. As we were seeing bias in outputs, we also wanted to try Hidden Naive Bayes. There is no available code or fomrat for Hidden Naive Bayes, so we developed it from scratch. All these steps were also performed parallely on Data Mining tool called Weka which helped us compare and identify differences. Finally, accuracies were compared and the difference found was very little.!
